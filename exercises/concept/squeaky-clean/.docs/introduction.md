# Introduction

## Character operations

Clojure characters are `java.lang.Character` primitives, and we can manipulate them via interop using the methods in the [Character class][java-character-class].

## String utilities

Clojure ships with a powerful string processing library, [clojure.string][clojure-str]. This is often more idiomatic than interop.
